# good-gulp
Hey there, good-gulp is a small gulp config I wrote for myself to quickly set up small high performing websites. It provides you with three commands: gulp, gulp build and gulp publish. The first one is for working on your website, the second one is to make your site ready to go live and the final one is to transfer your files to an Amazon S3 Bucket.

The good-gulp config is written to my taste (and limited by my knowledge), so you may not agree with some of my choices. Nevertheless, I do believe good-gulp can relieve anyone who wants to make a website using all the fancy stuff (sass, live reloading) and have it optimized for performance from configuration headaches. More on my choices here.

## list of features


## to do
+ check if publish works x (seems bucket has to be ireland)
+ clean up the file
+ add javascript optimization and features
+ html partials
+ thoroughly test it
+ make webpack version with es6



good-gulp is a webpage with all my good-gulp projects

I created these configs to always have a starting point ready whenever I have an idea I want to carry out. Sometimes that involves setting up a single page really fast, sometimes that involves creating an entire blog only to let it die a slow death...

You should understand that good-gulp is not perfect. Please treat any of the good-gulp boilerplates responsibly. I do have tested them and I am working with them, so they're probably fine. But hey, we are all wrong all the time.

If you feel that you should completely alter them, or even just a little bit, feel free. Also, if you have questions, tips or any other feedback -> @ me.

I hope that any webdev or designer just starting out will find some use in these. Please feel free to ask me questions about this. 

- basic (for optimized one page html creation and deployment) (look into s3, netlify & gh pages deployment)
- javascript (with webpack, es6, etc.)
- multipager (with nunjucks)

- bloggah (with hugo)
