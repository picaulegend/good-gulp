# good-gulp
Hey there, good-gulp is a small gulp config I wrote for myself to quickly set up small high performing websites. It provides you with three commands: gulp, gulp build and gulp publish. The first one is for working on your website, the second one is to make your site ready to go live and the final one is to transfer your files to an Amazon S3 Bucket.

The good-gulp config is written to my taste (and limited by my knowledge), so you may not agree with some of my choices. Nevertheless, I do believe good-gulp can relieve anyone who wants to make a website using all the fancy stuff (sass, live reloading) and have it optimized for performance from configuration headaches. More on my choices here.
